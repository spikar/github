## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}


data = fpp2::wmurders

# Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

library(forecast)


plot.ts(data, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'wmurders')

tsdisplay(arima(data, order = c(0,0,0))$residuals)

tsdisplay(arima(data, order = c(0,1,0))$residuals)


#We can see that the residual plot of the ARIMA model with p(AR)=0, d(I)=1, q(MA)=0 
#is like white noise and does not show any trend which means we do not need to go beyond
#the first difference. Now, looking at the ACF and PACF plots, I see a major peak at lag 2
#so we can try taking MA = 1.
#Next, we calculate theAIC and BIC values of the model. '''

model1 = arima(data, order = c(0,1,0))

model1_aic = AIC(model1) 
model1_bic = AIC(model1, k = log(length(data)))

c(model1_aic,model1_bic)

# Next, we try the ARIMA model with p(AR)=0, d(I)=1 and q(MA)=1.

model2 = arima(data, order = c(0,1,1))

tsdisplay(arima(data, order = c(0,1,1))$residuals)

c(AIC(model2), AIC(model2, k = log(length(data))))


# We can still see a major peak at lag 2 so we can try taking MA = 2.


tsdisplay(arima(data, order = c(0,1,2))$residuals)

model3 = arima(data, order = c(0,1,2))

c(AIC(model3), AIC(model3, k = log(length(data))))

# Now, we do not see any major peak. So, this can be our final model.

# the lags can also be suggestive of an AR(1) or AR(2) model.
# So, we try with p=1, d=1, q=0


tsdisplay(arima(data, order = c(1,1,0))$residuals)

model4 = arima(data, order = c(1,1,0))

c(AIC(model4), AIC(model4, k = log(length(data))))

# We can see a major peak at lag 2. So, we can try with p=2, d=1, q=0

tsdisplay(arima(data, order = c(2,1,0))$residuals)

model5 = arima(data, order = c(2,1,0))

c(AIC(model5), AIC(model5, k = log(length(data))))

# Now,we have a model with no major peaks and one of the lowest AIC and BIC values. 

# But, according to the question, we will go with moving average model, model3:

model_final = arima(data, order = c(0,1,2))

c(AIC(model_final), AIC(model_final, k = log(length(data))))






#Q2. It is common for books and lecture notes on time-series models to omit the 
#intercept term because it does not really add anything of substance to 
#understanding the model form (it is just a shift in location).
#The constant term only has an effect when d=0. So, we should not use a constant
#term in our model.



# Q3.

model_final = arima(data, order = c(0,1,2))

tsdisplay(model_final$residuals)


#The model is satsfactory because the residual plot appears likr white noise we 
#do not see any trend in the residual plot.


#Q4.

forecast = forecast(object = model_final,h=3)

print(forecast)

plot(forecast)

#Q5.

model_auto = auto.arima(data,max.d = 1)

print(model_auto)

tsdisplay(model_auto$residuals)



#auto.arima() gives a model with p=0, d=1, q=0.

#Although the residual plot does not show any trend,
#the ACF and PACF plots show major peaks at lag 2.

#Considering these, our model with p=0, d=1, q=2 
#is a better model than the one chosen with auto.arima()
